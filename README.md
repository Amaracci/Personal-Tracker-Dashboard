# Personal Tracker Dashboard
## Project Overview
We often hear “track your spending”, but it’s easy to get overwhelmed with numbers. So, I built a dashboard that makes it simple to see where money comes from, where it’s going, and what patterns are forming over time.

This tracker was developed as part of a training led by Freedom Oboh on Excel dashboards. While balancing work and learning, I took my time to complete the project and I’m really glad I did.
## Tools & Features
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables for dynamic summaries
- Charts & Graphs for intuitive visualization
- Slicers for monthly filtering
- Custom layout and formatting for a modern, user-friendly interface
## What the Dashboard Shows
### Available Balance
A quick overview of how much is left in the account.
### Total Income vs Total Expenses
Two clean line charts help visualize inflow vs outflow over time — a great way to understand how spending tracks against earnings.
### Income Sources Breakdown
Income is grouped into three main categories:
- Data with Decision (freelance/contract)
- YouTube
- Teachable (online courses)
This provides clarity on which source contributes the most — and it’s clear that Data with Decision makes up the bulk at 76%.
### Top Spending Categories
Here’s where things get interesting:
- Rent takes up the largest chunk at $9,000.
- Groceries and Clothes follow.
- Entertainment and cash loans make up smaller but still notable amounts.
### Monthly & Weekly Transactions
- Monthly Chart: Shows how spending and credit activities evolve over the months.
- Weekly Chart: Highlights heavy transaction days, in this case, Sundays seem to have the highest volume of credits.
## Key Insights
- Income is strong, but spending on Rent and Groceries is significant. This shows stability but also the importance of budgeting around fixed costs.
- Entertainment and cash loans suggest some discretionary spending, this might be an area to trim if savings goals increase.
- Sundays are the biggest transaction days, this could indicate a weekly routine of transfers, subscriptions, or bulk shopping.
- Data with Decision is clearly the primary income source. It may be worth exploring how to scale or replicate that success in the other streams.

## Suggested Actions
- Set monthly saving goals after rent and groceries are covered — build a buffer.
- Explore scaling YouTube and Teachable revenue for more income diversity.
